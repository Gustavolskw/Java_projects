This project is an API built using **Java, Java Spring, Flyway Migrations, PostgresSQL as the database, and Spring Security and JWT for authentication control.**

The API was developed for my [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-YCcOjPD0), to demonstrate how to configure Authenticatio and Authorization in Spring application using Spring Security.

## API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

```markdown
